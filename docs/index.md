BigML Node.js Bindings
======================

[BigML](https://bigml.com) makes machine learning easy by taking care
of the details required to add data-driven decisions and predictive
power to your company.
Unlike other machine learning services, BigML
creates
[beautiful predictive models](https://bigml.com/gallery/models) that
can be easily understood and interacted with.

These BigML Node.js bindings allow you to interact with BigML.io, the API
for BigML. You can use it to easily create, retrieve, list, update, and
delete BigML resources (i.e., sources, datasets, models and
predictions).

This module is licensed under the [Apache License, Version
2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

Support
-------

Please report problems and bugs to our [BigML.io issue
tracker](https://github.com/bigmlcom/io/issues).

Discussions about the different bindings take place in the general
[BigML mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/bigml). Or join us
in our [Campfire chatroom](https://bigmlinc.campfirenow.com/f20a0).

Requirements
------------

Node 0.10 is currently supported by these bindings.

The only mandatory third-party dependencies are the
[request](https://github.com/mikeal/request.git),
[winston](https://github.com/flatiron/winston.git) and
[form-data](https://github.com/felixge/node-form-data.git) libraries.

The testing environment requires the additional 
[mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha) package that can be installed
with the following command:

    $ sudo npm install -g mocha

Installation
------------

To install the latest stable release with
[npm](https://npmjs.org/):

    $ npm install bigml

You can also install the development version of the bindings by cloning the
Git repository to your local computer and issuing:

    $ npm install .

Testing
-------

The test suite is run automatically using `mocha` as test framework. As all the
tested api objects perform one or more connections to the remote resources in
bigml.com, you may have to enlarge the default timeout used by `mocha` in
each test. For instance:

    $ mocha -t 20000

will set the timeout limit to 20 seconds.
This limit should typically be enough, but you can change it to fit
the latencies of your connection. You can also add the `-R spec` flag to see
the definition of each step as they go.

Importing the modules
---------------------

To use the library, import it with `require`:

    $ node
    > bigml = require('bigml');

this will give you access to the following library structure:

    - bigml.constants       common constants
    - bigml.BigML           connection object
    - bigml.Resource        common API methods
    - bigml.Source          Source API methods
    - bigml.Dataset         Dataset API methods
    - bigml.Model           Model API methods
    - bigml.Ensemble        Ensemble API methods
    - bigml.Prediction      Prediction API methods
    - bigml.BatchPrediction BatchPrediction API methods
    - bigml.Evaluation      Evaluation API methods
    - bigml.LocalModel      Model for local predictions
    - bigml.LocalEnsemble   Ensemble for local predictions


Authentication
--------------

All the requests to BigML.io must be authenticated using your username
and [API key](https://bigml.com/account/apikey) and are always
transmitted over HTTPS.

This module will look for your username and API key in the environment
variables `BIGML_USERNAME` and `BIGML_API_KEY` respectively. You can 
add the following lines to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` to set
those variables automatically when you log in::

    export BIGML_USERNAME=myusername
    export BIGML_API_KEY=ae579e7e53fb9abd646a6ff8aa99d4afe83ac291

With that environment set up, connecting to BigML is a breeze::

    connection = new bigml.BigML();

Otherwise, you can initialize directly when instantiating the BigML
class as follows::

    connection = new bigml.BigML('myusername',
                                 'ae579e7e53fb9abd646a6ff8aa99d4afe83ac291')

Also, you can initialize the library to work in the Sandbox environment by
setting the third parameter `devMode` to `true`::

    connection = new bigml.BigML('myusername',
                                 'ae579e7e53fb9abd646a6ff8aa99d4afe83ac291',
                                 true)

Quick Start
-----------

Let's see the steps that will lead you from [this csv
file](https://static.bigml.com/csv/iris.csv) containing the [Iris
flower dataset](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) to
predicting the species of a flower whose `sepal length` is `5` and
whose `sepal width` is `2.5`. By default, BigML considers the last field
(`species`) in the row as the
objective field (i.e., the field that you want to generate predictions
for). The csv structure is::

    sepal length,sepal width,petal length,petal width,species
    5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa
    4.9,3.0,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa
    4.7,3.2,1.3,0.2,Iris-setosa
    ...

The steps required to generate a prediction are creating a set of
source, dataset and model objects::

```js
    var bigml = require('bigml');
    var source = new bigml.Source();
    source.create('./data/iris.csv', function(error, sourceInfo) {
      if (!error && sourceInfo) {
        var dataset = new bigml.Dataset();
        dataset.create(sourceInfo, function(error, datasetInfo) {
          if (!error && datasetInfo) {
            var model = new bigml.Model();
            model.create(datasetInfo, function (error, modelInfo) {
              if (!error && modelInfo) {
                var prediction = new bigml.Prediction();
                prediction.create(modelInfo, {'petal length': 1})
              }
            });
          }
        });
      }
    });
```

Note that in our example the `prediction.create` call has no associated
callback. All the CRUD methods of any resource allow assigning a callback as
the last parameter,
but if you don't the default action will be
printing the resulting resource or the error. For the `create` method:

    > result: 
    { code: 201,
      object: 
       { category: 0,
         code: 201,
         content_type: 'text/csv',
         created: '2013-06-08T15:22:36.834797',
         credits: 0,
         description: '',
         fields_meta: { count: 0, limit: 1000, offset: 0, total: 0 },
         file_name: 'iris.csv',
         md5: 'd1175c032e1042bec7f974c91e4a65ae',
         name: 'iris.csv',
         number_of_datasets: 0,
         number_of_ensembles: 0,
         number_of_models: 0,
         number_of_predictions: 0,
         private: true,
         resource: 'source/51b34c3c37203f4678000020',
         size: 4608,
         source_parser: {},
         status: 
          { code: 1,
            message: 'The request has been queued and will be processed soon' },
         subscription: false,
         tags: [],
         type: 0,
         updated: '2013-06-08T15:22:36.834844' },
      resource: 'source/51b34c3c37203f4678000020',
      location: 'https://localhost:1026/andromeda/source/51b34c3c37203f4678000020',
      error: null }


The generated objects can be retrieved, updated and deleted through the
corresponding REST methods. For instance, in the previous example you would
use:

```js
    bigml = require('bigml');
    var source = new bigml.Source();
    source.get('source/51b25fb237203f4410000010' function (error, resource) {
        if (!error && resource) {
          console.log(resource);
        }
      })
```
to recover and show the source information.

You can also generate local predictions using the information of your
models::

```js
    bigml = require('bigml');
    var localModel = new bigml.LocalModel('model/51922d0b37203f2a8c000010');
    localModel.predict({'petal length': 1},
                       function(error, prediction) {console.log(prediction)});
```

And similarly, for your ensembles

```js
    bigml = require('bigml');
    var localEnsemble = new bigml.LocalEnsemble('ensemble/51901f4337203f3a9a000215');
    localEnsemble.predict({'petal length': 1}, 0, 
                          function(error, prediction) {console.log(prediction)});
```

will generate a prediction by combining the predictions of each of the models
they enclose. The example uses the `plurality` combination method (whose code
is `0`. Check the docs for more information about the available combination
methods).

Types of resources
------------------

Currently there are six types of resources in bigml.com:

- **sources** Contain the data uploaded from your local data file after
processing (interpreting field types or missing characters, for instance).
You can set their locale settings or their field names or types. These resources
are handled through `bigml.Source`.

- **datasets** Contain the information of the source in a structured summarized
way according to their file types (numeric, categorical, text or datetime).
These resources are handled through `bigml.Dataset`.

- **models** They are tree-like structures extracted from a dataset in order to
predict one field, the objective field, according to the values of other
fields, the input fields. These resources
are handled through `bigml.Model`.

- **predictions** Are the representation of the predicted value for the
objective field obtained by applying the model to an input data set. These
resources are handled through `bigml.Prediction`.

- **ensembles** Are a group of models extracted from a single dataset to be
used together in order to predict the objective field. These resources
are handled through `bigml.Ensemble`.

- **evaluations** Are a set of measures of performance defined on your model
or ensemble by checking predictions for the objective field of
a test dataset with its provided values. These resources
are handled through `bigml.Evaluation`.

- **batch predictions** Are groups of predictions for the objective field
obtained by applying the model or ensemble to a dataset resource. These
resources are handled through `bigml.BatchPredictions`.

Creating resources
------------------

As you've seen in the quick start section, each resource has its own creation
method availabe in the corresponding resource object. Sources are created
by uploading a local csv file:

```js
    var bigml = require('bigml');
    var source = new bigml.Source();
    source.create('./data/iris.csv', {name: 'my source'}, true,
      function(error, sourceInfo) {
          if (!error && sourceInfo) {
            console.log(sourceInfo);
          }
      });
```
The first argument in the `create` method of the `bigml.Source` is the csv
file, the next one is an object to set some of the source properties,
in this case its name, a boolean that determines if retries will be used
in case a resumable error occurs, and finally the chosen callback.
The arguments are optional (for this method and all
the `create` methods of the rest of resources).

It is important to instantiate a new resource object (`new bigml.Source()` in
this case) for each different resource, because each one stores internally the
parameters used in the last REST call. They are available
to be used if the call needs to be retried. For instance, if your internet
connection falls for a while, the `create` call will be retried a limited number
of times using this information unless you explicitely command it by using the


For datasets to be created you need a source object or id or another dataset
object or id as first argument in the `create` method. In the first case, it
generates a dataset using the data of the source and in the second,
the method is used to generate new datasets by splitting the original one.
For instance,

```js
    var bigml = require('bigml');
    var dataset = new bigml.Dataset();
    dataset.create('source/51b25fb237203f4410000010',
      {name: 'my dataset', size: 1024}, true,
      function(error, datasetInfo) {
          if (!error && datasetInfo) {
            console.log(datasetInfo);
          }
      });
```

will create a dataset named `my dataset` with the first 1024
bytes of the source. And

```js
    dataset.create('dataset/51b3c4c737203f16230000d1',
      {name: 'split dataset', sample_rate: 0.8}, true,
      function(error, datasetInfo) {
          if (!error && datasetInfo) {
            console.log(datasetInfo);
          }
      });
```

will create a new dataset by sampling 80% of the data in the original dataset.

Similarly, for models and ensembles you will need a dataset as first argument,
evaluations will need a model as first argument and a dataset as second one and
predictions need a model as first argument too:

```js
    var bigml = require('bigml');
    var evaluation = new bigml.Evaluation();
    evaluation.create('model/51922d0b37203f2a8c000010',
                      'dataset/51b3c4c737203f16230000d1',
                      {'name': 'my evaluation'}, true,
      function(error, evaluationInfo) {
          if (!error && evaluationInfo) {
            console.log(evaluationInfo);
          }
      });
```

Newly-created resources are returned in an object with the following
keys:

-  **code**: If the request is successful you will get a
   `constants.HTTP_CREATED` (201) status code. Otherwise, it will be
   one of the standard HTTP error codes [detailed in the
   documentation](<https://bigml.com/developers/status_codes>).
-  **resource**: The identifier of the new resource.
-  **location**: The location of the new resource.
-  **object**: The resource itself, as computed by BigML.
-  **error**: If an error occurs and the resource cannot be created, it
   will contain an additional code and a description of the error. In
   this case, **location**, and **resource** will be `null`.

Bigml.com will answer your `create` call immediately, even if the resource
is not finished yet (see the
[documentation on status
codes](<https://bigml.com/developers/status_codes>) for the listing of
potential states and their semantics). To retrieve a finished resource,
you'll need to use the `get` method described in the next section.

Getting resources
-----------------

To retrieve an existing resource, you use the `get`
method of the corresponding class. Let's see an example of model retrieval:

```js
    var bigml = require('bigml');
    var model = new bigml.Model();
    model.get('model/51b3c45a37203f16230000b5',
              true,
              'only_model=true;limit=-1',
              function (error, resource) {
        if (!error && resource) {
          console.log(resource);
        }
      })
```

The first parameter is, obviously, the model id, and the rest of parameters are
optional. Passing a `true` value as the second argument (as in the example)
forces the `get` method to retry to
retrieve a finished model. In the previous section we saw that, right after
creation, resources evolve
through a series of states until they end up in a `FINISHED` (or `FAULTY`)
state.
Setting this boolean to `true` will force the `get` method to wait for
the resource to be finished before
executing the corresponding callback (default is set to `false`).
The third parameter is a query string
that can be used to filter the fields returned. In the example we set the
fields to be retrieved to those used in the model (default is an empty string).
The callback parameter is set to
a default printing function if absent.


Updating Resources
------------------

Each type of resource has a set of properties whose values can be updated.
Check the properties subsection of each resource in the [developers
documentation](<https://bigml.com/developers>) to see which are marked as
updatable. The `update` method of each resource class will let you modify
such properties. For instance,

```js
    var bigml = require('bigml');
    var ensemble = new bigml.Ensemble();
    ensemble.update('ensemble/51901f4337203f3a9a000215',
      {name: 'my name', tags: 'code example'}, true,
      function (error, resource) {
        if (!error && resource) {
          console.log(resource);
        }
      })
```

will set the name `my name` to your ensemble and add the
tags `code` and `example`. The callback function is optional and a default
printing function will be used if absent.

If you have a look at the returned resource
you will see that its status will
be `constants.HTTP_ACCEPTED` if the resource can be updated without
problems or one of the HTTP standard error codes otherwise.

Deleting Resources
------------------

Resources can be deleted individually using the `delete` method of the
corresponding class.

```js
    var bigml = require('bigml');
    var source = new bigml.Source();
    source.delete('source/51b25fb237203f4410000010', true,
      function (error, result) {
        if (!error && result) {
          console.log(result);
        }
      })
```

The call will return an object with the following keys:

-  **code** If the request is successful, the code will be a
   `constants.HTTP_NO_CONTENT` (204) status code. Otherwise, it wil be
   one of the standard HTTP error codes. See the [documentation on
   status codes](<https://bigml.com/developers/status_codes>) for more
   info.
-  **error** If the request does not succeed, it will contain an
   object with an error code and a message. It will be `null`
   otherwise.

The callback parameter is optional and a printing function is used as default.

Downloading Batch Predictions' output
-------------------------------------

Using batch predictions you can obtain the predictions given by a model or
ensemble on a dataset. The output is accessible through a BigML url and can
be stored in a local file by using the download method.

```js
    var bigml = require('bigml');
    var batchPrediction = new bigml.BatchPrediction(),
      tmpFileName='/tmp/predictions.csv';
    // batch prediction creation call
    batchPrediction.create('model/52e4680f37203f20bb000da7',
                           'dataset/52e6bd1a37203f3eac000392',
                           {'name': 'my batch prediction'},
        function(error, batchPredictionInfo) {
          if (!error && batchPredictionInfo) {
            // retrieving batch prediction finished resource
            batchPrediction.get(batchPredictionInfo, true,
              function (error, batchPredictionInfo) {
                if (batchPredictionInfo.object.status.code === bigml.constants.FINISHED) {
                  // retrieving the batch prediction output file and storing it
                  // in the local file system
                  batchPrediction.download(batchPredictionInfo,
                                           tmpFileName,
                    function (error, cbFilename) {
                      console.log(cbFilename);
                    });
                }
              });
          }
        });
```

If no `filename` is given, the callback receives the error and the
request object used to download the url.

Listing, Filtering and Ordering Resources
-----------------------------------------

Each type of resource has its own `list` method that allows you to
retrieve groups of available resources of that kind. You can also add some
filters to select
specific subsets of them and even order the results. The returned list will
show the 20 most recent resources. That limit can be modified by setting
the `limit` argument in the query string. For more information about the syntax
of query strings filters and orderings, you can check the fields labeled
as *filterable* and *sortable* in the listings section of [BigML
documentation](<https://bigml.com/developers>) for each resource. As an
example, we can see how to list the first 20 sources 

```js
    var bigml = require('bigml');
    var source = new bigml.Source();
    source.list(function (error, list) {
        if (!error && list) {
          console.log(list);
        }
      })
```

and if you want the first 5 sources created before April 1st,
2013:

```js
    var bigml = require('bigml');
    var source = new bigml.Source();
    source.list('limit=5;created__lt=2013-04-1',
      function (error, list) {
        if (!error && list) {
          console.log(list);
        }
      })
```

and if you want to select the first 5 as ordered by name:

```js
    var bigml = require('bigml');
    var source = new bigml.Source();
    source.list('limit=5;created__lt=2013-04-1;order_by=name',
      function (error, list) {
        if (!error && list) {
          console.log(list);
        }
      })
```

In this method, both parameters are optional and, if no callback is given,
a basic printing function is used instead.

The list object will have the following structure:

-  **code**: If the request is successful you will get a
   `constants.HTTP_OK` (200) status code. Otherwise, it will be one of
   the standard HTTP error codes. See [BigML documentation on status
   codes](<https://bigml.com/developers/status_codes>) for more info.
-  **meta**: An object including the following keys that can help you
   paginate listings:

   -  **previous**: Path to get the previous page or `null` if there
      is no previous page.
   -  **next**: Path to get the next page or `null` if there is no
      next page.
   -  **offset**: How far off from the first entry in the resources is
      the first one listed in the resources key.
   -  **limit**: Maximum number of resources that you will get listed in
      the resources key.
   -  **total\_count**: The total number of resources in BigML.

-  **objects**: A list of resources as returned by BigML.
-  **error**: If an error occurs and the resource cannot be created, it
   will contain an additional code and a description of the error. In
   this case, **meta**, and **resources** will be `null`.

a simple example of what a `list` call would retrieve is this one, where
we asked for the 2 most recent sources:

```js
    var bigml = require('bigml');
    var source = new bigml.Source();
    source.list('limit=2',
      function (error, list) {
        if (!error && list) {
          console.log(list);
        }
      })
    > { code: 200,
      meta: 
       { limit: 2,
         next: '/andromeda/source?username=mmerce&api_key=c972018dc5f2789e65c74ba3170fda31d02e00c0&limit=2&offset=2',
         offset: 0,
         previous: null,
         total_count: 653 },
      resources: 
       [ { category: 0,
           code: 200,
           content_type: 'text/csv',
           created: '2013-06-11T00:01:51.526000',
           credits: 0,

Local Models
------------

A remote model encloses all the information required to make
predictions. Thus, once you retrieve a remote model, you can build its local
version and predict locally. This can be easily done using
the `LocalModel` class.

```js
    var bigml = require('bigml');
    var localModel = new bigml.LocalModel('model/51922d0b37203f2a8c000010');
    localModel.predict({'petal length': 1},
                       function(error, prediction) {console.log(prediction)});
```

As you see, the first parameter to the `LocalModel` constructor is a model id
(or object). The constructor allows a second optional argument, a connection
object (as described in the [Authentication section](#authentication)).

```js
    var bigml = require('bigml');
    var myUser = 'myuser';
    var myKey = 'ae579e7e53fb9abd646a6ff8aa99d4afe83ac291';
    var localModel = new bigml.LocalModel('model/51922d0b37203f2a8c000010',
                                          new bigml.BigML(myUser, myKey));
    localModel.predict({'petal length': 1},
                       function(error, prediction) {console.log(prediction)});
```

The predict method can also be used labelling input data with the corresponding
field id.

```js
    var bigml = require('bigml');
    var localModel = new bigml.LocalModel('model/51922d0b37203f2a8c000010');
    localModel.predict({'000002': 1},
                       function(error, prediction) {console.log(prediction)});
```

When the first argument is a finished model object, the constructor creates
immediately
a `LocalModel` instance ready to predict. Then, the `LocalModel.predict`
method can be immediately called in a synchronous way.


```js
    var bigml = require('bigml');
    var model = new bigml.Model();
    model.get('model/51b3c45a37203f16230000b5',
              true,
              'only_model=true;limit=-1',
              function (error, resource) {
        if (!error && resource) {
          var localModel = new bigml.LocalModel(resource);
          var prediction = localModel.predict({'petal length': 3});
          console.log(prediction);
        }
      })
```
Note that the `get` method's second and third arguments ensure that the
retrieval waits for the model to be finished before retrieving it and that all
the fields used in the model will be downloaded respectively. Beware of using
filtered fields models to instantiate a local model. If an important field is
missing (because it has been excluded or
filtered), an exception will arise. In this example, the connection to BigML
is used only in the `get` method call to retrieve the remote model information.
The callback code, where the `localModel` and predictions are built, is
strictly local.

On the other hand, when the first argument for the `LocalModel` constructor
is a model id, it automatically calls internally
the `bigml.Model.get` method to retrieve the remote model information. As this
is an asyncronous procedure, the `LocalModel.predict` method must wait for
the built process to complete before making predictions. When using the
previous callback syntax this condition is internally ensured and you need
not care for these details. However, you may
want to use the synchronous version of the predict method in this case too.
Then you must be aware that the `LocalModel`
`ready` event is triggered on completion and at the same time the
`LocalModel.ready` attribute is set to true. You can wait for
the `ready` event to make predictions synchronously from then on like in:

```js
    var bigml = require('bigml');
    var localModel = new bigml.LocalModel('model/51922d0b37203f2a8c000010');
    function doPredictions() {
      var prediction = localModel.predict({'petal length': 1});
      console.log(prediction);
    }
    if (localModel.ready) {
      doPredictions();
    } else {
      localModel.on('ready', function () {doPredictions()});
    }
```

Local Ensembles
---------------

As in the local model case, remote ensembles can also be used locally through
the `LocalEnsemble` class to make local predictions. The simplest way to
create a `LocalEnsemble` is:

```js
    var bigml = require('bigml');
    var localEnsemble = new bigml.LocalEnsemble('ensemble/51901f4337203f3a9a000215');
    localEnsemble.predict({'petal length': 1}, 0, 
                          function(error, prediction) {console.log(prediction)});
```

This call will download all the ensemble related info (and each of its component
models) and use it to predict by combining the predictions of each individual
model using a majority system (classifications) or an average system
(regressions). The first argument of the `LocalEnsemble.predict` method
is the input data to predict from, the second one is a code that sets the
combination method:

- 0 for **plurality**: one vote per each model prediction
- 1 for **confidence weighted**: each prediction's vote has its confidence as
    associated weight.
- 2 for **distribution weighted**: each model contributes to the final
    prediction with the distribution of possible values in the final
    prediction node weighted by its distribution weight (the number of
    instances that have that value over the total number of instances in the
    node).
- 3 for **threshold**: one vote per each model prediction. Needs an additional
    object with two properties: threshold and category. The category is
    predicted if and only if the number of predictions for that category is
    at least the threshold value.
    Otherwise, the prediction is plurality for the rest of predicted
    values.

An example of `threshold` combination method would be:

```js
    var bigml = require('bigml');
    var localEnsemble = new bigml.LocalEnsemble('ensemble/528ba06e37203f5bc3000000');
    localEnsemble.predict({'petal length': 0.9, 'petal width': 3.0}, 3,
                          {threshold: 3, category: 'Iris-virginica'},
                          function(error, prediction) {console.log(prediction)});
```

As in `LocalModel`, the constructor of `LocalEnsemble` has as
first argument the ensemble id (or object) or a list of model ids (or objects)
as well as a second optional connection
argument. Building a `LocalEnsemble` is an asynchronous process because the
constructor will need to call the `get` methods of the remote ensemble object
and its component models. Thus, the `LocalEnsemble.predict` method will have
to wait for the object to be entirely built before making the prediction. This
is internally done when you use the callback syntax for the `predict` method.
In case you want to call the `LocalEnsemble.predict` method as a synchronous
function, you should first make sure that the constructor has finished building
the object by checking the `LocalEnsemble.ready` attribute and listening
to the `ready` event. For instance,

```js
    var bigml = require('bigml');
    var localEnsemble = new bigml.LocalEnsemble('ensemble/51901f4337203f3a9a000215');
    function doPredictions() {
      var prediction = localEnsemble.predict({'petal length': 1}, 2);
      console.log(prediction);
    }
    if (localEnsemble.ready) {
      doPredictions();
    } else {
      localEnsemble.on('ready', function () {doPredictions()});
    }
```
would first download the remote ensemble and its component models, then
construct a local model for each one and predict using these local models.
In this case, the final prediction is made by combining the individual local
model's predictions using a distribution weighted method.

The same can be done for an array containing a list of models, regardless of
whether they belong to an ensemble or not:

```js
    var bigml = require('bigml');
    var localEnsemble = new bigml.LocalEnsemble([
      'model/51bb69b437203f02b50004ce', 'model/51bb69b437203f02b50004d0']);
    localEnsemble.predict({'petal length': 1}, 0, 
                          function(error, prediction) {console.log(prediction)});
```
Logging configuration
---------------------

Logging is configured at startup and uses the
[winston](https://github.com/flatiron/winston) logging library. Logs are sent
both to console and a `bigml.log` file by default. You can change this
behaviour by using:

- BIGML_LOG_FILE: path to the log file.
- BIGML_LOG_LEVEL: log level (0 - no output at all, 1 - console and file log,
                              2 - console log only, 3 - file log only,
                              4 - console and log file with debug info)

For instance,

```batch
export BIGML_LOG_FILE=/tmp/my_log_file.log
export BIGML_LOG_LEVEL=3
```

would store log information only in the `/tmp/my_log_file.log` file.
